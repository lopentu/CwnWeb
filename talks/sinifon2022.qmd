<!-- # Abstract -->

<!-- In this talk, I'll first present the current status of Chinese Wordnet (CWN 2.0), including the manually created sense-related resources and their computational representations (sense embeddings, gloss vectors, sense-tagged corpus) and applications (WSD, etc.). Then I'll discuss the challenges of developing wordnet-like resources in the Chinese context from diachronic and synchronic perspectives. -->

# Background

`Sinica BOW` (@huang2004sinica)

`Chinese Wordnet at Academia Sinica`

`Chinese Wordnet at NTU Taiwan`

::: callout-note
Note that there are many Chinese Wordnet(s).
:::

## WordNet architecture

-   synset (synonymous set)
-   Lexical relations

![](./figures/wn.graph.png){fig-align="right"}

# Chinese Wordnet

-   Follow PWN (in comparison with Sinica BOW)

-   Word segmentation principle [@chu2017mandarin]

-   Corpus-based decision

-   Manually created (sense distinction, gloss with controlled vocabulary, etc)

## History and Status qua

-   latest release 2022

![](./figures/cwn.png)

## CWN 2.0

-   The most comprehensive and fine-grained sense repository and network in Chinese

![](./figures/eat.png)

# Theories

## Meaning facets vs senses

(co-predication)

## Gloss as lexicographic resources with add-ons annotations

# Data Statistics

## Zipf's law (no surprise)

-   Most words have small number of senses (Zipf's law)

![](figures/comp.jpg)

## Comparison with others

-   CWN is the best candidate

## test

```{ojs}
//| panel: input
viewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(
  [32, 50], 
  {value: 35, step: 1, label: "Bill length (min):"}
)
viewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"], 
  { value: ["Torgersen", "Biscoe"], 
    label: "Islands:"
  }
)
```

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{ojs}
Plot.rectY(filtered, 
  Plot.binX(
    {y: "count"}, 
    {x: "body_mass_g", fill: "species", thresholds: 20}
  ))
  .plot({
    facet: {
      data: filtered,
      x: "sex",
      y: "species",
      marginRight: 80
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.frame(),
    ]
  }
)
```

## Data

```{ojs}
Inputs.table(filtered)
```
:::

```{ojs}
data = FileAttachment("penguins.csv").csv({ typed: true })
```

```{ojs}
filtered = data.filter(function(penguin) {
  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length_mm &&
         islands.includes(penguin.island);
})
```

## Gloss statistics

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## test py

```{python}
print("hello")
```

# GraphAPI and Visualization

![](./figures/cwnvis.png)

## Network Visualization

```{r}
#library(visNetwork)
#visNetwork(nodes, links, width="100%", height="400px", background="#eeefff",
#           main="Network", submain="And what a great network it is!",
#           footer= "Hyperlinks and mentions among media sources")

# Computational Semantic Representations

-   open-sourced ([github](https://github.com/lopentu))

## `SemCor` manually sense-tagged corpus

## Word Sense Tagger

WSD: The Problems

-   The task as currently defined does not allow for generalization over different words $\rightarrow$ learning is word-specific.

-   Need training data for every sense of every word, and no chance with unknown words. (unsupervised approaches perform consistently worse than supervised approaches)

-   Cannot capture the sense alternation regularities

</p>

## Distributed approach to model the 'Gradience'

-   *gradience* is found is many linguistic categories.

-   Regular polysemy detection: Using word vector [@di2013regular]or sense vector [@lopukhina2016regular] to detect sense alternations (such as `FOOD` or `ANIMAL`)

-   Recent **(contextualized) vector representation** could help us in locating where a word meaning is on the continuum (/in the multidimensional semantic space).

## WSD with Transformer (1)

-   Leveraging wordnet *glosses*. using `GlossBert` [@huang2019glossbert]
    -   a BERT model for word sense disambiguation with gloss knowledge.
-   Our extended `GlossBert` model on CWN gloss+SemCor reports 82% accuracy.

::: notes
conducting *context-gloss* pairs, and fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on SemCor3.0 training corpus, and achieves SOTA performance on several English all-words WSD tasks.

## Word Sense frequencies

## Word Sense Embeddings

## Others

-   `gloss2vec`
-   Jacob character: -Chinese character (root morpheme) lies in the meaning core

# Challenges and On-going Works

> `wordhood` haunting issues `Ontolex`

## Construction Sense Disambiguation

-   Construction has its own sense
    -   ( '還在那邊')

## Archaic and Modern sense

## Diachronic word sense tracking

## Mandarin Varieties

-   '真香'，
-   chivar

## Ontologies

-   synset-structured (lexicalized) ontology doesn't work well

# Conclusions

-   Chinese(s) are neighbors themselves.

-   Wordnet framework serves as a mirror for Chinese synchronic and diachronic varieties.
